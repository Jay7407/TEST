         <p>Dr. Morris spent a great part of his life in Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. The last twenty-six years were spent in LaGrange, Kentucky 
          where his family was reared and educated. His home is now the property of the Grand Chapter of Kentucky and is maintained as a Shrine in honor 
          of the Master Builder of our Order.</p>
         <p>The &quot;Little Red Brick School Building in Mississippi&quot; is owned by the Grand Chapter of Mississippi and is maintained as a Shrine in 
          honor of Dr. Morris' writing of the Ritual in Mississippi.</p>
         <p>On July 31, 1888, when the news of his death was sent to all parts of the world, profound grief was expressed at his passing as his whole life 
          had been devoted to the uplifting of humanity. He was buried in the cemetery in La Grange, Kentucky, where admiring friends from all over the 
          world have erected a tall marble shaft in his memory. On one side of the shaft is the Square and Compasses and on the other side is the Five Pointed 
          Star.</p>
         <p>Dr. Morris was generous, tender of heart and loving in disposition. He was happiest when sharing with others that which the Lord had bestowed 
          upon him.</p>
         <p>As the stars which bedeck the canopy of heaven are the beauty and glory of the night and light the pathway of man on his journey through life, 
          so may the beautiful Star in the East, with all its significance, ever remain the glory of the Order of the Eastern Star and light the pathway 
          of the members in the fulfillment of their vows.</p>
