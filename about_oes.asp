                  <p>The Order of the Eastern Star is a Masonic-related fraternity of women and men dedicated to charity, truth and loving kindness. Although not 
          a part of the Masonic fraternity, membership is based on a Masonic affiliation or relationship, a belief in God, and a desire to acquire additional 
          knowledge and for self improvement. </p>
                  <p>The degrees of the Order of the Eastern Star teach lessons of fidelity, constancy, loyalty, faith and love. These degrees are presented in a 
          beautiful ritualistic ceremony designed to not only teach the lessons, but also to provide insight for future study and understanding. </p>
                  <p>Local Eastern Star Chapters select their own charities and places of service in their own communities. Some statewide projects include scholarships 
          for ministerial students, other general scholarships for youth, and supporting a home for aged members. Each year special charities are selected 
          for that year`s emphasis and might include volunteer programs in elementary schools or volunteers in literacy programs and specific community 
          outreach. </p>
                  <p>Eastern Star proudly support young women`s organizations such as Rainbow for Girls and Job`s Daughters. Many Chapters actively support DeMolay 
          for Boys. </p>
                  <p>The Eastern Star is also a social organization with frequent formal events and ceremonies. Being a member is a wonderful and a fulfilling way 
          of life. Please ask an Eastern Star to tell you more about it! </p>
                  <p>The Order of the Eastern Star was conceived, written and taught by a Master Mason to provide a place where both men and women could work and 
          serve side by side. It is now the largest Fraternal organization in the world to which both men and women belong. </p>
                  <p>Master Masons in good standing, the wives, mothers, daughters, legally adopted daughters, widows, sisters, half-sisters, step daughters and 
          step-sisters of Master Masons in good standing at the time of death are eligible for membership. Rainbow Girls and Job's Daughters with three 
          or more years membership in those youth groups before petitioning are eligible for membership in the OES. </p>
                  <p>The fraternal order is comprised of people with deep religious convictions and spiritual values open to all faiths except no faith. </p></td>
